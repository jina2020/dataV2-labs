* If it is so important as the title says (is it really a big step?) or you think it is more important than the title let's suggests.
Can be important and can be a big step if perfectioned.
* Which part of ML or AI is used and how is it related to ML or AI.
An artificial intelligence, named Deep Neural Network (DNN) (fr. réseau de neurones profonds ) using fundtional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) (fr. résonance magnétique fonctionnelle (IRMf))
* What did they do to take the data.
The researchers used three subjects and they were shown images of things
* Which data did they use.
The signals recorded by the fMRI scanner
* How did they do to build the model. Which type of model is?
Different algorithms for each person. DNN.
* Do you know any other project that applies the same techniques? Could you use something for another use case?
For dreams (ils pensent utile pour analyser l’état psychique d’individus, comprendre des maladies psychologiques ou encore commander des machines par la pensée.)
* Do you find any ethical implications? Collateral effects?
If the person agrees, I don't find any ethical implications.
* Do you know any news related?
No.
